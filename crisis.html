        I saw a MiG pull up in a steep climb approximately five or six miles at 12 o’clock and called it out. As we continued on course of 068°, several aircraft came into view:
        F4s, F-105s, and four to six MiGs.<br>
        As we slacked off G’s I was inside and approximately 1500 - 2000 feet to the rear of lead, and at this time I saw a MiG-17 low and right, apparently going after Huntley.

    <p>A VPAF MiG-17 Fresco (top left) dives on a USAF F-105 Thunderchief (bottom right), opening fire with its three cannons. The action is captured in the gunsight of a second F-105
    as the American pilot lines up to fire on the Fresco.

    <p>For the North Vietnamese pilots this is their second engagement of the day, having earlier fended off four flights of F-105 strike aircraft guarded by two F-4 Phantom D
    MiGCAP flights - a total of around 24 fighters. The MiGs attacked over the Black River to the South of Hanoi, forcing the American Thunderchiefs to jettison their bombs and retreat before reaching the 
    railway yards they had intended to strike.
    </p>
    <p>Guided into perfect ambush positions by a network of ground controllers, the Vietnamese pilots present a significant threat to the Americans despite far smaller numbers.
    The VPAF engage from all directions at once, attacking head on with older MiG-17s while faster and more advanced MiG-21 Fishbeds attack from behind. 
    Today 6 Fishbeds are flying with four to eight Frescos, one of which is severely damaged from an engagement with a Phantom earlier in the day.
    </p>
    <p>The Americans return with a larger force, including an extra 'Iron Hand' flight of EF-105Fs to defend the strike aircraft along with the two MiGCAP flights. The MiGs engage over Hanoi but are
    overwhelmed, allowing the F-105 strike flights to break off and complete their attack on the Dai Loi railway bridge. The damaged Fresco is unlucky once more, and goes down after being raked with
    20mm cannon fire from the lead Iron Hand aircraft.</p>

    <p class="w3-center">4th January 1989 - 64km North of Tobruk, Libya</p>

    <p>Libyan MiG-23MS Flogger targeted by an American F-14A Tomcat flying from the USS Kennedy.</p>

    <div class="w3-hide" id="text3">
    <p>At 11:55am an E-2C Hawkeye from the aircraft carrier USS Kennedy tracks two Libyan MiG-23MS Floggers taking off from Al Bumbah air base and heading North towards the carrier group.
    Two F-14A Tomcats from fighter squadron VF-32 "Fighting Swordsmen" are directed to intercept.
    </p>
    <p>Communications intercepted by a nearby EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft reveal that the Libyan pilots have been ordered to meet the F-14s head on rather than turn 
    away after being targeted by US radars as they usually would. As the distance between the aircraft shrinks the US pilots descend to 3000ft, flying low over the sea to exploit a blind spot in the MiG's 
    radar discovered through Project Constant Peg test flights of clandestinely purchased Soviet aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>At a separation distance of 22km, the radar intercept officer of the lead F-14 Gypsy 207 fires a radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow. The missile does not hit it's target. At 10km separation Gypsy 207 
    fires another AIM-7 but this also misses.
    </p>
    <p>At 8km separation the aircraft are locked in a knife fight. The Tomcats break formation, splitting off to fly in different directions. Both Libyan fighters turn to face the second Tomcat Gypsy 202 
    head on. Gypsy 202 fires an AIM-7, downing the first Libyan MiG whilst Gypsy 207 turns to the other, firing a heat seeking AIM-9 sidewinder at a separation of 1.5km. The missile hits just behind the cockpit,
    downing the second Flogger.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the aggressive manoeuvres flown by the Libyan pilots, neither of the MiG-23s ever activated the onboard RP-22SM radars that would allow them to target and fire on the Tomcats. In fact, 
    communications between the ground controllers and pilots ceased after the initial order was given to intercept the F-14s. The Libyan pilots found themselves merged in a cut-throat dogfight with
    no authorisation to use their weapons.</p>
